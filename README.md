# AI Travel Planner 

An intelligent agent-based travel planner that understands natural language queries like:

> *"Plan a trip from Pune to Beawar on 15 August in AC class, preferably by train or bus."*

It parses the query, fetches real-time travel options, filters results using reasoning, and recommends the best route. The project will soon be accessible via WhatsApp as a conversational bot.
